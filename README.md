# OpenChirp
An open source implementation of the [Chirp](chirp.io) data-over-audio protocol.

## What's Chirp?
Back in 2016, the [developers behind Chirp](https://www.chirp.io/about) devised of a protocol for encoding and transmitting data using the audial range, as this would be a common interface between a great many different devices. 

Put simply, a sender and receiver make an _a priori_ agreement of which frequencies correspond to which letters of a shared alphabet. The sender then takes an arbitrary message, maps it to the corresponding frequency range alongside a couple of error handling symbols, whilst the listener transforms the frequencies it hears back into the original data. Provided the channel isn't too lossy, data can be reliably reconstructed back on the listener's side. 

The coolest thing? When you're not sending the symbols in the `40kHz` (ultrasonic, inaudable) range, they sound like a cute little bird singing its goddamn head off.

## What's in these examples?
Each example contains a transmitter and receiver example. Additionally, the example projects are capable of listening to _themselves_, so there's no need for swapping between multiple devices whilst you're just testing stuff out.

## Dependencies
The Chirp protocol uses the [_Galois Transform_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory) to encode and append redundant symbols to the payload in order to counteract the effects of the lossy surrounding environment. This is a complicated process, though luckily it is also a widely used one. This repository makes use of [`zxing-core`](https://github.com/zxing/zxing), which applies the `GenericGF` `class` that is used to encode and decode QR codes.

## Background
There's little lying around about the fundamentals in how Chirp protocol style data is put together; most notably because the official protocol obscures the lower-level information on how signal data is encoded. Take the [chirp-arduino example](https://github.com/chirp/chirp-arduino):

```
void loop() {
   chirp.chirp("parrotbilllllahcm4");
   delay(2000);
}
```
In this example, the Arduino microcontroller will repeatedly chirp the signal `"parrotbilllllahcm4"` every two seconds. This can be split into two parts; the _data frame_ (`parrotbill`) and the _error frame_ (`lllahcm4`). The `error frame` is actually a function of the _data frame_, since its symbol data is encoded using a Galois polynomial. This process has been left open for speculation for quite a while until now, so let's see how it works.

## Interested in contributing?
This is an active project. Currently, we've only provided an example implementation in [Android](https://github.com/Cawfree/OpenChirp/tree/master/android), but due to the diverse nature of sound, there are very many platforms that could be configured as a transmitter or receiver for the protocol. Please drop me a line at `cawfree@gmail.com` if you're interested.

        A popular Reed-Solomon code is RS(255,223) with 8-bit symbols. Each codeword contains 255 code word bytes, of which 223 bytes are data and 32 bytes are parity. For this code:
        n = 255, k = 223, s = 8
        2t = 32, t = 16
        RS(18, 10)
        n = 18, k = 10, s = 5
        2t = 8, t = 2
        // For example, the maximum length of a code with 8-bit symbols (s=8) is 255 bytes.
        // therefore 31 bytes maximum
        // therefore... we know we're appending 8 bits.. sending 10 = 18
        // the data appends (31 - (8 + 10)) zeros, which are... 13. 13 zeros.
        // Reed-Solomon codes may be shortened by (conceptually) making a number of data symbols zero at the encoder,
        not transmitting them, and then re-inserting them at the decoder.
